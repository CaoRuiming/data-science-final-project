### Team m a c h i n e l e a r n i n g is back for some brief round 2 updates! 
Since this post has been made optional, we're just going to keep it nice and brief by showcasing some of the things we've produced. We still have a lot to get to, but as of now we have some results in both machine learning and data visualization.

## Data processing
We've made great progress in data processing. While originally a large roadblock, we mostly have this under control now.

## Machine Learning


## Data Visualization
We built a mini-framework for visualizing our data in scatterplot format, and this can eventually be extended to support other types of visualizations. As it stands now, our plot can easily be made interactive and allow users to choose which columns to sizeBy, colorBy, and which columns to use for the X-axis and Y-axis. The plot has zooming capabilities that take advantage of D3 Brush, and hovering over a datapoint will reveal some information about it.

See the below plot, which is colored by

## Next Steps


  
### That's it for now, see y'all at the next checkpoint! May all your connections be 4g or higher :)
